# maj-scripts-vibe — Claude Code entry point

This file exists only because Claude Code auto-loads `CLAUDE.md` by
convention. All actual instructions live in `AGENTS.md` (shared across
every agent that works in this repo — Codex, Antigravity/Gemini, or any
future agent) so there is one source of truth instead of per-agent forks
that drift apart.

Do not add Claude-specific instructions to this file. Add them to
`AGENTS.md` — if a rule matters, every agent needs it, not just this one.
That includes memory: this workspace's `memory/` folder is the one shared
memory store — do not keep repo context in a Claude-only memory store
instead.
